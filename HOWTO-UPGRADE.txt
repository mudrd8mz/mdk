This is how I install the custom-scripts version locally. Do this after
updating mdk from upstream.

I have mdk installed in a virtual environment

    $ cd ~/git/mdk

    $ source ~/bin/mdkenv/bin/activate

    $ pip install .

    $ deactivate


To re-create the virtual environment:

    $ cd ~/bin/mdkenv

    $ python3 -m venv .
